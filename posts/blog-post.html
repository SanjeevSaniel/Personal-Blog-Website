            Naini Lake, Nainital
          </caption>
          <p>
            This pretty lake is Nainital’s centrepiece and is said to be one of the emerald-green eyes of Shiva’s wife, Sati (naina is Sanskrit for eye) that fell to earth after her act of self-immolation.<br/><br/> Boaters will row you around the lake for ₹210 in the brightly painted gondola-like boats, or the Nainital Boat Club will sail you around for ₹500. Pedal boats can also be hired.

          <caption class="caption">The Taj Mahal</caption>
          <p>
            The Taj Mahal is an enormous mausoleum complex commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the remains of his beloved wife. Constructed over a 20-year period on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India, the famed complex is one of the most outstanding examples of Mughal architecture, which combined Indian, Persian and Islamic influences. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that seems to change color depending on the daylight. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning symbol of India’s rich history.

          <p>Over 15km around, Dal Lake is Srinagar's jewel, a vast sheet of water reflecting the carved wooden balconies of the houseboats and the misty peaks of the Pir Panjal mountains. Flotillas of gaily painted shikaras (gondola-like taxi boats) skiff around the lake, transporting goods to market, children to school and travellers to delightful houseboats inspired by originals from the Raj era.</p>

            <p>Lazily navigating the radiant backwaters of Kerala is like floating off into a dream. What is probably India's most laid-back state has 900km of interconnected rivers, lakes, canals and lagoons lined with swaying coconut palms and picturesque villages.</p>

              Lotus Temple, Bahāʾī Faith house of worship, or mashriq al-adhkār (Arabic; a place where the uttering of the name of God arises at dawn), in New Delhi. In the early 21st century it was one of only seven mashriqs in the world.

            <caption class="caption">Golden Temple, Amritsar</caption>
            <h2>Sikh Temple</h2>
            <p>
              The holiest Sikh shrine, Amritsar's Golden Temple is a place where spirituality pushes through into the material world. A continuous chain of pilgrims circles the Sarovar, a water tank excavated by the fourth Sikh guru in 1577, while priests chant passages from the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, in the gold-encased chapel at the centre of the pool. To visit is to glimpse the soul of the Sikh religion, characterised by honour, courage and hospitality – best exemplified by the Guru-Ka-Langar, the vast kitchen for pilgrims that feeds 100,000 people daily.

            <h2>Tribal Northeast India</h2>
            <p>
              If the crowds wear you down in Rajasthan or Kerala, point your compass northeast to India's rugged tribal states, linked to the rest of India by just a narrow strip of land, and culturally closer to Myanmar, Bhutan and Bangladesh. For decades the region was off-limits due to colonial-era red tape, but visiting is getting easier all the time. If you venture to the mountainous north of Arunachal Pradesh, or former headhunter villages in forested Nagaland, you'll be stepping off the tourist map into a world of tribal customs and untamed scenery.
